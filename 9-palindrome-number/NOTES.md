Most straight forward algo-
1. create  list of digits
2. iterate the list from front and and i f there are any two pointers which don't match return false
3. return true otherwise
​
Is there a way to do this without having to create an extra list (extra O(n),
​
that is there a way to get the first and last digit without having to add it to something
